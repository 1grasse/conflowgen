Background
----------

In maritime logistics, simulation and optimization are commonly-used methods for planning, solving problems and evaluating solutions. For testing new solutions, an extensive amount of realistic data are urgently needed but constantly scarce. Since comprehensive real-life data are often unavailable or are classified, the generation of synthetic data is a helpful way to get around this issue. Sometimes even the owners of comprehensive container flow data can benefit from synthetic data, e. g. for testing their business models, as well as to improve and adapt to the future. A synthetic data generator for the creation of incoming and outgoing containers from the perspective of a maritime container terminal has already been proposed by SÃ¶nke Hartmann in 2004. Since his approach is now more than 15 years old, there are significant changes in the shipping industry. We took this changes as a motivation to rethink, rework, and improve the existing generator.

Therefore, we created an improved container flow generator, named ConFlowGen, which allows the user to create synthetic but yet realistic data of container flows for maritime container terminals.

Together with the software itself, which is provided on GitHub, you may want to have a look at our accompanying publication on (LINK TBD).
